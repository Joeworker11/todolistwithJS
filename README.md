# todolistwithJS
This is a simple to-do list application with Javascript, CSS and HTML.

1. It can add, remove, delete all and save --> download the written <li> elements into a textfile. 

2. I also added binded keyboard events so if you press "ENTER" it excecutes the given command, and by pressing the "DELETE" button it clears the content of the page.

3. It also has an edit function which is waiting for completion. 


Tasks to be fulfilled:

  - I am planning to add some CSS styling.
  - A function to be able to send to "To-do List" via E-mail.
  - It will be responsive.
  - I have already done litt projects like this with Python Flask, Django and I am going to create one with Flutter framework as well.
